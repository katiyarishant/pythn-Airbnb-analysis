# 🏡 Airbnb Data Analysis Project

This project involves exploratory data analysis (EDA) on an Airbnb dataset to uncover insights about listings, prices, availability, host information, and more. It helps understand customer behavior, pricing trends, and factors that influence Airbnb bookings.

## 📊 Project Objectives

- Analyze Airbnb listing data using Python
- Understand which factors influence listing prices
- Identify host behavior and availability trends
- Perform detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset contains Airbnb listing data, including:
- Listing names and locations
- Prices and availability
- Host details
- Room types
- Number of reviews

> 📝 Dataset Source: Kaggle.com

## 📌 Technologies Used

- Python 🐍
- Pandas 🐼
- Matplotlib 📊
- Seaborn 🎨
- Jupyter Notebook 📓

## 🧠 Key Insights

- Price distribution varies significantly by room type and location.
- Entire homes/apartments are listed at a much higher average price than private or shared rooms.
- Listings with more reviews tend to be more affordable and highly booked.
- Many hosts have only one listing, indicating a large number of casual renters.
- Availability and pricing show patterns that can help optimize revenue strategy for hosts.

## 📈 Conclusion

To improve sales, Airbnb and its hosts should focus on offering entire homes, setting competitive prices based on location, increasing listing availability, and encouraging more guest reviews. These actions can lead to higher visibility, better guest trust, and increased bookings.
